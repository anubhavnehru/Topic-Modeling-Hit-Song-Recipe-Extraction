## Overview

We aim to offer music producers and composers valuable guidance and insights on crafting hit songs. This project involves the analysis of song lyrics across different decades to uncover emotional trends. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this analysis explores the evolving emotional landscapes portrayed in songs.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis comprises song lyrics spanning from the 1960s to the 2010s. Each decade's emotional content, including joy, trust, fear, anger, and anticipation, was quantified to identify trends and shifts in lyrical themes. We collected this data by scraping various online sources(AcclaimedMusic.net,etc), including music databases and lyrics repositories. The scraping process involved extracting lyrics while adhering to website terms of service and copyright regulations.

## Preprocessing

In preprocessing the lyrics dataset for the top 4000 artists and songs from A-Z Lyrics, we performed key steps such as word tokenization, removal of stop words, punctuations, and irrelevant terms like "ooh" and "aah," along with lemmatization. These measures were crucial for creating a clean and standardized corpus, setting the stage for meaningful analysis and interpretation of the lyrical content in the project.

## Emotional Analysis

Using NLP libraries, emotional content in the lyrics was quantified across key emotional dimensions: joy, trust, fear, anger, and anticipation. Each decade's emotional distribution was analyzed to identify prevalent emotional themes.

## Visualization

The analysis of sentiment and emotional trends were visualized using charts and graphs to clearly represent how sentiments and emotional content in song lyrics have shifted over different decades.

## Topic Modelling

Topic modeling reveals a constant thread of personal themes in song lyrics spanning decades. Notably, while the core focus on personal narratives remains steadfast, there's a nuanced shift in secondary themes. The evolution extends from specific relationships to broader expressions, highlighting the enduring importance of establishing a personal connection with the audience. This insight deepens our understanding of lyrical evolution, emphasizing the enduring emotional resonance conveyed through music.

## Recommendations 

- Sentiments : Mix in more positivity in your tunes, but don't shy away from a bit of realness. Strike that balance – upbeat with a touch of raw emotion – to connect with your listeners on a deeper level.
- Emotions : Enhance your music with increased joy to offset declining trust emotions, and add a touch of controlled anger for a contemporary edge in line with current trends.
- Topics : Enhance your songwriting by balancing timeless personal themes with broader expressions, ensuring a deep and lasting connection with your audience.

## Conclusion

This project offers insights into the changing emotional landscape reflected in song lyrics over time. The analysis provides a glimpse into societal and cultural shifts captured through the emotional content of music.
